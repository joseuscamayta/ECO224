# Papper The "MINCER EQUATION" thirty years after schooling,experience, and earnings by Thomas Lemieux
Report 1

This paper talks about how the Mincer equation has envolved over time. After 30 years, we have a lot of data and information, but we continue use the main parameters from Mincer equation to earnings determination. Throughout the article it analyzes whether the variables used in the equation are correct and how some are not correct at certain times. 

The work is divided into 6 parts. In the first part, he analyzes the importance of the natural logotype to transform profits, because logs are typically used in econometric models for reasons of convenience or fit. In the following parts, he analyzes each of the variables, for example, if education must enter linearly and experience as a quadratic equation

One of the main conclusions is that the equation is a good approximation, it may overstate or understate the effect of experience and schooling on earnings for some groups. Especially, it tends to understate the effect of experience on the earnings of young workers. The model also tends to overstate the effect of skills on earnings at the very low end of the skill distributions. The basic Mincer human capital earnings function does not appear to fit the data nearly as well in the 1980s and 1990s as it did in the 1960s and 1970s. This is basically because  wages are an increasingly convex function of years of schooling. 

In this paper the evidence suggests that the Mincer equation remains a useful and accurate benchmark in a stable environment. However, 30 years later, the Mincer equation does not fit the data quite as well as it used to because we are no longer in a stable environment where educational achievement grows smoothly.
